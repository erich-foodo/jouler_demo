  Coldest Day: January 12 (-2°F) - Design day performance validated
  Hottest Day: July 18 (94°F) - Cooling capacity confirmed
  Days Below 32°F: 96 days (higher heating demand)
  Days Above 85°F: 18 days (moderate cooling demand)

Weather Impact on Performance:
  Colder winter increased heating load by ~8% vs typical year
  TEN advantage amplified during cold periods (ASHP degradation)
  Mild summer reduced cooling load by ~2% vs typical year
  Overall: Weather increased TEN economic value vs normal year

Weather-Normalized Annual Performance:
  Actual 2024 Savings: $114,333
  Weather-Normalized Savings: $109,850 (typical year projection)
  Weather Benefit: $4,483 (colder winter favored TEN vs ASHP)

Climate Outlook:
  Region trending toward milder winters (-0.3°F/decade)
  Future TEN advantage may decrease slightly as ASHP cold-weather 
    performance becomes less critical
  Still expect 35%+ savings even in mild winters due to fundamental 
    efficiency advantage

KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Performance Achievements:
  ✓ Exceeded energy savings target (38% actual vs 35% projected)
  ✓ Maintained 99%+ system uptime throughout year
  ✓ Validated digital twin accuracy (CVRMSE 26%, within standards)
  ✓ Achieved carbon reduction goals (87% vs ASHP baseline)
  ✓ Generated $157k total economic value (savings + incentives)

Operational Learnings:
  • Cold weather performance confirms geothermal advantage over ASHP
  • Virtual metering successfully enabled building-level attribution
  • Centralized O&M delivered 85% cost savings vs distributed systems
  • Ground thermal sustainability confirmed (2°F annual depletion acceptable)
  • Peak demand reduction (38%) drives significant utility cost savings

Areas for Optimization:
  1. Pump Energy: 8.2% of total electrical - investigate VFD optimization
  2. Load Balancing: Consider data center or cooling-dominant loads to 
     improve annual ground thermal balance
  3. Expansion Priority: 103 kW available capacity - target commercial 
     buildings for higher load factors
  4. Predictive Maintenance: Pump seal failures (2 events) - implement 
     condition monitoring

2025 Recommendations:
  □ Expand network to 40-42 buildings (utilize available capacity)
  □ Implement advanced pump optimization controls
  □ Add data center thermal load for ground loop balancing
  □ Enhance building submetering for granular end-use analysis
  □ Pursue additional RTC revenue opportunities
  □ Consider energy storage integration for demand charge reduction

Investment Case:
  Current Performance: $114k annual savings + $49k incentives = $163k/year
  Expansion Potential: Add 7 buildings × $3,250 avg savings = $23k additional
  Projected 2025 Value: $186k total annual economic benefit

The Framingham Thermal Energy Network has demonstrated technical, economic, and 
environmental performance that validates the business case for thermal networks 
over individual building electrification. Virtual metering and digital twin M&V 
provide the measurement rigor required for utility programs, carbon accounting, 
and operational optimization.
