TEN efficiency advantage in cold weather conditions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Weather Impact on Economics:
  Q4 Heating Degree Days: 2,184 HDD (11% above 10-year average)
  Colder quarter = increased heating load = greater TEN advantage
  ASHP efficiency degradation at <32°F drove 42% of Q4 savings

Utility Rate Environment:
  No rate changes during Q4 2024
  Winter rates remained stable at $0.15/kWh blended
  Demand charges: $16/kW (unchanged)

Market Comparison:
  Regional ASHP installations (2024): Average $14,500/unit installed
  TEN avoided capital (if retrofit): $507,500 (35 units × $14,500)
  Annual operating savings: $113,800 (22.5% return on avoided capital)

  • Demand charges: Building-level peak aggregation

Cost Assumptions:
  • Utility rates: Actual tariff from [Utility Name]
  • O&M labor: Regional HVAC technician rates
  • Parts/materials: Market pricing (2024)
  • Inflation adjustment: 2.8% annual (CPI)

Measurement Infrastructure:
  Physical Metering: 15 sensors (energy, flow, temperature)
  Virtual Metering: 24 building-level points
  Financial Tracking: Automated invoice reconciliation
  Model Calibration: CVRMSE 26%, NMBE 9% (hourly - compliant)
  Last Validated: December 31, 2024

All cost calculations verified against actual utility bills and maintenance records.
Baseline ASHP costs derived from regional market data and manufacturer specifications.
